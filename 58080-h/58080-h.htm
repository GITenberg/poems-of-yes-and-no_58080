<p class="poem">
  tell me, in this high land of mountained length<br />
  where time is green and space big-bellied<br />
  with fruitful plains rockribbed by corn and bean<br />
  for simple courage, do you know strength<br />
  as something earned through bitterness of need<br />
  in narrow streets and tortured rooms, oh hungry lean<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  listen, above the winding road come sounds<br />
  descending on bells, sky voices and wind<br />
  mixing with the shy four footed ones' cries,<br />
  what do they tell, can you hear from the grounds<br />
  of city skyscrapers through the tunnelthinned<br />
  walls that rail the nervetracked brain with wooden ties<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  look you, whose eyes are wise with too much seen<br />
  through doors and windows, in whom the sunlight<br />
  is confined by steel canyons and arctic<br />
  nights, here is heart space, here clouds rise between<br />
  warm currents to open roofs, see how the height<br />
  of climb and width of free brightens to tropic<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  taste this, you tongue lovers, you gourmets, you<br />
  who know the ends for which the palette buds<br />
  bloom to burst on a thousand sauces, wines,<br />
  rare meats and molded cheeses, what brew<br />
  is this, what essence extracted from muds<br />
  and rooted origins of leaf that taste defines<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  breathe, ah breathe again, purge out the unclear<br />
  lungs, the downbent head, smell has other use<br />
  than multiplies in shop and factory<br />
  to substitute the sense, no need to fear<br />
  the pure air here, to hide subtle and obtuse<br />
  behind the mob's excuse, here the wind blows free<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  reach out, know touch as up and down, the span<br />
  of head to heel, thigh to shoulder, each side<br />
  with rough of bark to blossom, stone to dust,<br />
  how else but by the feel, the real, can man<br />
  press nature to his will and impel his pride<br />
  in shaping to his needs an earth which he can trust<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  go up, your feet will take you high above<br />
  streets and buildings to a new position<br />
  forget the old appointments, you have a more<br />
  important one with God to measure love<br />
  not by the scrupled ways of acquisition<br />
  but freely as the stars that follow and explore<br />

  where he may press two lips against its crystal<br />
  depths&mdash;see how he leaps to kiss the imaged mist<br />

</p>

<p class="poem">
  my love is an alpine trail that mountains climb<br />

  for weak foot and tired brain&mdash;but death only<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  my love is a trumpet sustaining its call<br />

</p>

  my love is a dream where childhood fell asleep<br />
  beckoned by shadows that lengthen as they creep;<br />

<p class="poem">
  known coldest doubt and passionate release<br />
  the after peace of countless wars grown tired<br />

</p>

<p class="poem">
  how many changes seen: chance days<br />
  nights, the grays of violent and tame<br />
  mixed in the time's confusion<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  dreamed plans, wished hopes without cease<br />
  no single piece of life sought<br />
  without delusion<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  and yet have loved each coming, going blaze<br />
  each phase, willed and thrilled to every flame<br />
  that brightened the illusion<br />

  again the after rain and shine of night<br />
  when mellow yellow patternings of light<br />
  make rivers run through streets of mirrors bright<br />
  to where the air brings thought from its seclude<br />
  as though a silver magnet drew a rood<br />
  about the mind's internal solitude<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  then is the darkness gentle to my sight<br />
  with glossy lamps to toss me into flight<br />
  and give to sleep the freeness of a kite<br />
  that after storm can rise in amplitude<br />

</p>

<p class="poem">
  a day red as a ripe warm plum<br />
  on the mouth<br />
  staining chin and blouse with summer<br />
  while leaves on a red tree flamed<br />
  in crimson joy<br />
  shamelessly<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  and there were other reds<br />
  for feathers dipped in blood<br />
  to sign youth's honor on a windless sky<br />
  running over rooftops<br />
  most solemneyed<br />
  earnestly<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  or red for something velvet deep<br />

<p class="poem">
  after the sunlight over barren fields<br />
  after the dry wind through stony creeks<br />
  we found our little green where lilies were<br />
  and knee deep oxen stood watching us<br />
  triumphant under trees... for this was peace<br />
  as nature meant nature's peace to be<br />
  with fertile soil made ready by its need<br />
  with instincts tamed in gentler ways than fear<br />
  with freedom measured freely as the sky<br />
  measures breath... we lay there side by side<br />
  breathing kisses, feeling the wet and cool<br />
  of bodies grassed in loving, each a groove<br />
  within a groove seeking counterpart<br />
  with close-open-close, with light in dark<br />
  and waves lapping... we heard the overflow<br />
  of lake on buttressed dam down sluiced walls<br />
  making music in ditches, singing birth<br />
  to stalks in the earth, with giant surge<br />
  of up and out bringing humanity<br />
  a greater day for love... then happily<br />
  we rose and barefoot walked the golden green<br />
  to where horses and men waded beneath<br />
  multifoliate rays of setting sun<br />
  their work done before the darkness come<br />
  to cheat them... together all of us swam<br />
  glad for the fresh clean water which ran<br />
  on hands and hoofs, on flesh and hide, like beams<br />
  bathing between, feeling our oneness sweet<br />
  reward, for the sun was a broken sword<br />
  pointing the peace towards our tomorrow<br />

  it was a silent evening I remember<br />
  through the river's mist it comes to me<br />
  a star pierced the air, white with speed<br />
  it leaped across the sky, slipped and fell<br />
  I heard its cry, it echoed in the sea<br />
  the swift wild cry of the scornful ember<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  alone I stood there, never had I need<br />
  of fellow rebel more, I a rebel<br />
  down the dark beach I ran, I stripped, time<br />
  was an eyeless reach across immensity<br />
  and I plunged deeply, they blamed it on the tide<br />
  the night, they had not seen infinity<br />
  like a vast unchanging vista wide<br />
  before me. if you go too far you'll drown<br />
  they said, ah no, they know the sublime<br />
  who reach for the falling star and go down<br />

<p class="poem">
  the day to day commitment to failure<br />
  that judgment daily argues against me<br />
  condemns me to despair... I am guilty<br />
  of more than silence... at times words fail your<br />
  wisest men and then intentionally...<br />
  but my silence like all my secrecies<br />
  has no defense, none conventionally,<br />
  my personal idiosyncrasies<br />
  no social crimes... when pride is pain and shame<br />
  an agony too keen for reason I<br />
  had no other weapon, who is to blame?<br />
  there was no intent to deceive or lie...<br />
  my absence is sufficient evidence,<br />
  voluntary exile, not providence<br />

ABOUT THE AUTHOR
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth Bartlett (1911-1994) was an American poet and writer noted
for her lyrical and symbolic poetry, creation of the new twelve-tone
form of poetry, founder of the international non-profit organization

</a>.
</p>

<p>
Bartlett's most notable achievements include:
</p>

<p>
&bull; Creation of a new form of poetry, "the twelve-tone poem," adapting
Arnold Schonberg's musical system to the verbal, accented sounds
of language.  Called "the Emily Dickinson of the 20th Century," her
concise lyrics have been praised by poets, musicians, and composers
alike.
</p>

<p>
&bull; Publication of 16 books of poetry, a group of edited anthologies,
and more than 1,000 poems, short stories, and essays published, for
example, in <i>Harper's</i>, <i>Virginia Quarterly</i>, <i>New York Times</i>, <i>North
American Review</i>, <i>Saturday Review</i>, <i>Prairie Schooner</i>, and in
numerous international collections.
</p>

<p>
&bull; Recipient of many fellowships, grants and awards, including NEA,
PEN Syndicate, fellowships at the Huntington Hartford Foundation,
Montalvo, Yaddo, MacDowell, Dorland Mt. Colony and Ragdale, travel
grants, and honors for introducing literature as part of the Olympics.
</p>

<p>
&bull; Founder of the Literary Olympics, to restore literature,
specifically poetry, as a vital part of the Olympics as it once
had been in ancient Greece.
</p>

<p>
Bartlett's poetry came to the attention of leading poets,
writers, and critics as diverse as Marianne Moore, Wallace Stevens,
Mark Van Doren, Conrad Aiken, Allen Tate, Alfred Kreymborg, Robert
Hillyer, Louis Untermeyer, Rolfe Humphries, John Ciardi, Richard
Eberhart, Richard Wilbur, Maxine Kumin, Robert M. Hutchins, Kenneth
Rexroth, William Stafford, and others.  Over the years, Bartlett
maintained an active and extensive correspondence with eminent poets,
writers, and literary critics; evident throughout this collected
literary correspondence are strong statements attesting to the
importance of her work.
</p>

<p>
About her first book of poetry, <i>Poems of Yes and No</i>, Marianne Moore
wrote: "I surely find good in the <i>Poems of Yes and No</i>....  The
clearness of the book is certainly beautiful."  Wallace Stevens
was impressed by <i>Poems of Yes and No</i> and wrote: "Your poems
give one a sense of intelligence and sensibility."  Alfred Kreymborg
was enthusiastic about the book: "You have found a style of your own
and developed it.  I say yes to your <i>Poems of Yes and No</i>.  This is a
distinguished volume as a whole.  I wish you well with this warm book.
Any poet might envy the courage and artistry of what you say, or
rather sing, there."  Further commendation came from Robert Hillyer,
who wrote: "Your poems are moving and unusual....  A distinguished
achievement!"
</p>

<p>
Her husband, Paul Alexander Bartlett (1909-1990) was an American
writer, artist, and poet.  He made a large-scale study of more than
350 Mexican haciendas, published novels, short stories, and poetry,
and worked as a fine artist in a variety of media.  For more detailed

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when

  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
